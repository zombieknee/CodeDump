** There is a small test.html file that actually runs the game **

This kata was based off of Conway's Game of Life. The rules are pretty simple and were
fairly easy to implement. It's been some time since I have worked with html5 and canvas
elements, but I think everything came out nicely.

My main issues were using the JasmineJS testing frame work. I have never heard of it
until this particular kata/interview combination. The framework seems relatively simple,
returning 'true' or 'false' on test cases. Some of the organizational syntax gave me some
trouble but I think I have managed pretty well. Some of the 'specs' as the tests are called
are some what rudimentary in my opinion, but I may be wrong as I have not worked in an
environment where TDD was formally enforced.

Over all I really enjoyed this kata and look forward to hearing some critiques and opinions!
